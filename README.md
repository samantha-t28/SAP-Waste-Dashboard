# SAP Waste Diversion Dashboard

Developed and designed a waste diversion dashboard for the Green Team that displays the previous two months of data, helping office staff stay informed and track progress towards zero-waste goals.

# Getting Started

* npm install
* npm start

# Phase 1: Design

* Each month, the office receptionist updates and uploads the current waste tracking data for the Green Team's lead to review. The data, presented in Excel format, poses a challenge in quickly discerning the bi-monthly differences in waste.

* The UI5 Web Components library, suggested by my mentor, proved to be user-friendly. Its straightforward documentation enabled me to efficiently select and implement suitable graph components into the design.

* The application consists of two main pages. The first page offers a detailed overview of waste data from the last two months, broken down by the types of waste as per the contractor's report.

* On the second page, images of actual objects are used to depict different categories, effectively illustrating the percentage change in waste over two months. This visual method aids office staff in better understanding the various waste categories.

# Phase 2: Development

* As the initial sole developer on this project, I chose React for its reusable components. These components encapsulate distinct functionalities and simplify codebase maintenance, which is particularly beneficial for interns who will develop additional features later on.
* Additionally, I utilized SASS due to its readability and scalability. This ensures that the project remains adaptable for future expansion.
